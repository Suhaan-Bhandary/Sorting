# Efficient implementations of Quicksort are not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items
# is not preserved. Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes O(n log n)
# comparisons to sort n items.

# It uses Divide and conquer to achieve the result.
